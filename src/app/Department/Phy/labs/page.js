      "The Engineering Physics Lab at APME lays the foundation for experimental knowledge in physics. It enables students to learn fundamental concepts, ranging from measuring gravitational acceleration to determining various properties of materials through well-designed and conceptualized experiments. A specially designed dark room facility is dedicated to conducting optical experiments. It provides students with hands-on experience in studying fundamental phenomena such as interference and diffraction of light. Through various experimental techniques, students learn to determine the wavelengths of different light sources by analyzing interference and diffraction patterns. The laboratory experience enhances the analytical, observational, and problem-solving skills of undergraduate students while strengthening their understanding of theoretical principles through practical application.",
